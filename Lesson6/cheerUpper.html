        "Out of all the people in the world, *you* — yes, you, " + nameInput.value + " — " +
        "ended up right here, clicking this button at exactly the age of " + ageInput.value + ". " +
        "That alone already makes this moment kind of special. " +

        "Being " + ageInput.value + " years old is a wild phase, honestly. " +
        "You’re old enough to understand things, young enough to still be curious, " +
        "and right now you’re using that curiosity in the best possible way. " +
        "Most people at the age of " + ageInput.value + " have no idea what they’re doing — " +
        "but here you are, learning, experimenting, and pressing buttons just to see what happens. " +

        "And let me say this clearly, " + nameInput.value + ": " +
        ageInput.value + " is an excellent age to start doing cool things. " +
        "It’s the kind of age where small decisions quietly turn into big wins later on. " +
        "Future " + nameInput.value + " is already somewhere ahead, " +
        "looking back at this exact moment and thinking, " +
        "‘Wow, I’m really glad I started back when I was only " + ageInput.value + ".’ " +

        "So take a second and appreciate yourself. " +
        "Appreciate that " + nameInput.value + " at the age of " + ageInput.value + " " +
        "chose curiosity over boredom, learning over scrolling, and trying over giving up. " +
        "That’s not small. That’s huge. " +

        "Honestly, if there were a leaderboard for being awesome at " + ageInput.value + ", " +
        nameInput.value + ", you’d be suspiciously high on it. " +
        "So keep going, keep clicking, keep learning — " +
        "because the world absolutely needs more " + nameInput.value + "s like you.";
