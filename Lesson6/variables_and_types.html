        //var is an older way of creating variables in JavaScript
        var myVariable; //this creates a variable but doesn't assign anything into it

        var myAssignedVariable = "sugar"; //here we both create and assign a variable

        //let creates a regular variable in JavaScript that you can reassign later
        let worldPeace = "soon";

        worldPeace = "not likely"; //you can re-assign a variable created with let

        const pi = 3.14159; //when you use const to create a variable, you cant reassign it later

        //pi = 2.5; //you cannot reassign a const, it will throw a console error

        //think of const as "the reference is constant"

        const player = {
            name: "Antti",
            score: 0
        }

        //player = "cat"; //still can't reassign a const

        player.score = 1;  //the thing assigned to a const can change, just you cant assign something else to the const

        //TYPES

        let myString = "abcdefg"; //a string type of variable

        //you can't or shouldn't really do math with strings, but JS is kind of weird when it comes to that...

        let memeString = "11";

        //console.log(memeString + 1); //console.logs 111

        console.log(memeString - 1); //logs 10 so here the math is weirdly working

        //Explanation:

        //the + operator is also used fo the concatenation of string like this:

        let firstPart = "Hello";

        let secondPart = " World";

        console.log(firstPart + secondPart); //logs Hello World

        console.log(firstPart - secondPart); //NaN because minus doesnt make sense here, how can you subtract "world" from "hello"??

        //so because + and - are used a bit differently in JS, when you subtract, a number looking string gets coerced into an actual number

        console.log(typeof(myString)); //checks the type of myString variable. Logs string 

        let myNumber = "123";

        console.log(typeof(myNumber)); //a string because of the quotes

        myNumber = 123;

        console.log(typeof(myNumber)); //now its a number

        //booleans are a very simple TYPE

        let myBool = "false";

         console.log(typeof(myBool)); //string

         myBool = false;

         console.log(typeof(myBool)); //boolean

         //where booleans really shine is when you want to be able to change the state of something to the opposite state, without even necessarily knowing the current state.
         //For example: we want to switch the light off, but the button can be already pressed up or down. But regarldless of the button position, we know that it will toggle the opposite of the current state (where lights are on)

        let lightsOn = true;

        const myButton = document.getElementById("switch");

        myButton.addEventListener("click", () => {

            lightsOn = !lightsOn; // this basically says "lightsOn" should be what its not

            if (lightsOn) {
                document.body.style.backgroundColor = "white";
            } else {
                document.body.style.backgroundColor = "black";
            }
        });

        //Arrays are another type in JS

        const topEmployees = ["Mike", "Kate", "Paul", "John"];

        console.log(typeof(employees)); //object (but its an array object)

        //we need to fire one of the worst employees and we will just draw a random lot

        console.log(topEmployees[0]); // you can get a certain slot from the array like this //logs Mike

        const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * topEmployees.length);

        alert("The person who just got fired is: " + topEmployees[randomIndex]);

        //Objects are data-entities that can hold more complex data than just variables or arrays

        let person = {
            name: 'John Doe',
            age: 30,
            email: "john@example.com",
            phone: "+3584383893"
        }

        //can you see how an array is not as nice for a collection of related values, because you need to remember the placement of those values
        //let personArray = ['John Doe', 30, "john@example.com", "+3584383893"]

        //Student question: How do you add quotations in strings? Like if I was the text itself to have quotes?

        //simple way to show double quotes as part of the string is to single quote the string:
        alert('She said "hello"');

        //If you need to show a single quote or apostrophe in the string, just double quote it
        alert("It's my life");

        //if you need a tricky mix of both single and double quotes, then you can always use the backslash to escape characters:
        alert("She said: \"It's my life\"");
